#   - PASS if the marker is present and every listed TU passes
#     both sub-criteria (no `INCLUDE_ASM("nonmatching", …)` lines
#     remain AND every function in the TU's `.o` is matched per
#     progress/report.json).
#   - FAIL otherwise, with the script's diagnostic surfaced.

# Skip semantics (exit 77): the marker references a TU that needs
# progress/report.json, but the file is missing (fresh clone, or
# `compile.py --setup` + `scripts/progress.sh` hasn't run yet).
# In that state we can't decide either way — defer to the next
