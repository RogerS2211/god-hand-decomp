"""Patch ee-as 2.10 to disable the R5900 short-loop assemble-time check.

This is the first instance of the policy ratified by DECISIONS.md
(patch vendored toolchain binaries when the alternative is significantly
more invasive).

What this changes (one byte):
  At file offset 0x20f54 the ee-as binary contains a `je` (0x74)
  immediately after `cmpl $0x0, 0x80e8888` (= `mips_opts.noreorder`).
  That conditional jump is the *skip-error* exit from the R5900 short-
  loop errata check at VMA 0x8068f4d / `append_insn+0x5ef`: when
  noreorder == 0 the check is skipped, otherwise ee-as raises the
  "problematic short loop for Emotion Engine in noreorder section"
  build-time error.  Our INCLUDE_ASM carve preamble emits `.set
  noreorder` by design (see include/include_asm.h), so any short
  carve below the threshold trips the gate.

  Flipping the byte from 0x74 (`je`) to 0xeb (`jmp`) makes the
  skip-error path *always* taken — the short-loop check is dead.
  Byte output for accepted inputs is unchanged (empirically verified
  by full retail-rebuild sha256 hold; see task body AC and the
  session retro for the regression-carve preflight evidence).

Idempotency contract:
  * If the file's sha256 already equals POST_SHA256, we log
    "already-applied" and exit 0 without writing.
  * Else if it equals PRE_SHA256, we verify the byte at OFFSET is
    EXPECTED_PRE_BYTE, flip it to NEW_BYTE, fsync, and confirm the
    new sha256 == POST_SHA256.
  * Else we refuse to apply (exit non-zero with a named error).
    This is the "someone bumped the ee-gcc tarball" branch: the
    patch must be re-derived and the sha256s re-pinned.

The script uses only the Python standard library; it's safe to run
before the project venv exists.
