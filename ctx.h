/* m2c context header for the God Hand decomp.
 *
 * Provides just enough types / macros / externs that an `m2c`-generated C
 * function compiles on its own while you iterate it toward a byte match.
 * This file is NOT in the matching-build link path (it is never #included
 * from anything under `src/`); changing it cannot perturb
 * `build/SLUS_215.03.elf` / `build/rel/*.rel` byte output. Header-only.
 *
 * Sections, in order:
 *   1. Width-alias typedefs (matches m2c's primitive emit + the PS2-era
 *      decomp convention).
 *   2. m2c "valid syntax" mode helpers (forwarded from
 *      `tools/m2c/m2c_macros.h` so m2c output with --valid-syntax
 *      still compiles in this context; no-op otherwise).
 *   3. Opaque struct shapes for the $a0 / $a1 argument types of common
 *      functions. Sized at "highest observed field offset + 4, rounded
 *      up to a multiple of 16".
 *   4. extern decls for the D_* globals those functions reference.
 *
 * If a declaration collides with an existing one in `include/**` once the
 * SCE / SN headers are vendored, prefer the header and drop the shim here.
