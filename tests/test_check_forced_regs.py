"""Unit tests for scripts/check_forced_regs.py (forced-register ratchet).

Offline; exercises the pure detection helpers (``strip_comments``,
``count_pins``, ``PIN_RE``) against synthetic source files in tmp_path.
These are the load-bearing logic: a false negative lets a forced-register
pin slip past the gate, a false positive on comment prose breaks every
commit.
